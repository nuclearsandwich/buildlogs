# Duck Orion 88-key

I received this keyboard waayy back in April or May, just as finals was ramping
up. I also wasn't sure what switches I wanted in it and eventually decided on
kryox lubricated clears. After some short testing of the springs I had
available, I disassembled 88 clear switches and re-assembled them lubricated
with very thick krytox on the slider and high viscosity oil on the stems and
springs.  Each switch then had SIP sockets placed in it for solderless LED
swapping.  The SIP sockets are just a little too short to comfortably fit the
Orion's through holes. I'll have to see about changing my source when I'm out
of these.

## The Specs

* Silver annodized aluminum case
* 88 Key layout, 1.25 1.25 1.25 6.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 1.25 bottom row, short right shift + 1x fn key.
* Standard QWERTY, fully programmable with LED and hardware macros
* Cherry MX Clear, 70g Korean-made springs, lubricated, SIP socket inserts for LEDs
* Cherry Stabilizers, clip-modded and lubricated
* Drawer liner for sound dampening.

## Lubricating switches.

This is dull work. Granted this was my first time lubricating switches but it
took me around 35 minutes to do ten at a time. I passed the time by watching
The Adventures of Pete and Pete and Clarissa Explains it All. I can see why
heavy builders like the switch lubing stations and I think I'm gonna need to
get one.

## Assembling the PCB

SMD soldering and microcontroller flashing are all done by the factory for this
board so all I needed to do was solder in the switches with LEDs. Sadly, I
screwed even that up.

I actually put this keyboard together with tactile greys and brought it to
KeyCon West, I was fairly certain it would be the only Orion and wanted to at
least show off Duck's design and solid construction relative to the KMAC and
456GT that would be there. Sadly, in my haste to build the keyboard once my
switches were finally ready, I forgot to remove and clip-mod the stabilizers.
Luckily I'd only done the four corners and the Backspace, so desoldering isn't
a huge undertaking. After being unable to effectively free the switches using
my soldapolt, I am however, shelving the project pending the delivery of my
Hakko 808 desoldering gun which I have ordered in anticipation of my next
projects which are all refurbishments of vintage keyboards.
