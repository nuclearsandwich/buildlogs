## About this bike

This is my favorite ride.
I got this bike from the mechanic after I wrapped the front derailleur around the crankset on my existing road bike.
I came by to check on the progress and it had just come in.
From the very first ride, it was incredible how amazing it felt.
I had never been sized for a bike and it was pure luck that this thing just happened to be perfect. It has been my primary mode of transport since like 2009?

It weighs a ton. I have no idea if it's cromoly or some other steel.
