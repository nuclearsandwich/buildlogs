## About this bike

This is my favorite ride.
I got this bike from the mechanic after I wrapped the front derailleur around the crankset on the road bike I inherited from my Uncle.
I came by to check on the progress and it and this new lovely had just come in.
It was massive and from the very first ride, it was incredible how amazing it felt.
I had never been sized for a bike and it was pure luck that this thing just happened to be perfect.
It has been my primary mode of transport since like 2009. Whoa.

It weighs a ton. I have no idea if it's cromoly or some other steel. Nor the year since these models use serial numbering system that no one seems to have deciphered yet. I'll add spec-ier details as I record them.
